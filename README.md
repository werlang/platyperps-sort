# About this repo

If you want to enter a delta neutral strategy on Solana network, you could use two perpetual positions on [Drift](https://app.drift.trade) and [Mango](https://trade.mango.markets) to simultaneously.
To do this, you should enter a short and long position on a given token.
I wont get into details about how the delta neutral strategy works, nor how a perpetual contract work.

# Platyperps

There is a useful website called [platyperps](http://www.platyperps.com/compare) which gives you a comparison between funding rates on both Mango and Drift platforms.
Thing is, it is a little annoying to do the math on every token to see which is giving the best value.

So I created this super simple script to do this for me. So why not share it?

## Usage

Copy and paste the contents of `sort.js` on the dev console (F12) when on platyperps website.
After that you should see a nice table (like the image below) showing sorted and useful information about every token.
Enjoy!
